  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Answers to the most important questions about digital property presentation",
    "q1": "Can I display a digital listing on a regular TV?",
    "a1": "Yes. The requirement is an internet connection and an integrated web browser. Most current Smart TVs meet these requirements. Alternatively, an external media player like a Chromecast or Fire TV Stick can be used.",
    "q2": "What's the difference between a regular TV and a signage display?",
    "a2": "A regular TV is designed for private use and is good for getting started. A professional signage display is designed for continuous 24/7 operation, offers higher brightness, longer lifespan, and is specifically intended for storefronts or commercial environments.",
    "q3": "Does the display also work in portrait format?",
    "a3": "Yes. Our solution supports both portrait and landscape format. The orientation can be individually set for each display and adjusted at any time.",
    "q4": "How does the QR code per property work?",
    "a4": "When creating a property, you can optionally add a link, for example to the property page on your own website. A QR code is automatically generated from this on the digital listing. Interested parties scan the code and go directly to the specified destination.",
    "q5": "How quickly are changes visible on the display?",
    "a5": "Changes are visible immediately after saving in the cloud portal. The displays automatically update the content, so the current status is always shown.",
    "q6": "How is the display selection and setup done?",
    "a6": "You can procure and set up the display yourself. Alternatively, we offer a full service – from selecting and procuring the right display to setup and optional on-site installation. Feel free to contact us, we'll find a suitable solution for your needs."
