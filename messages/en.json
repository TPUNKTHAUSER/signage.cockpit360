    "badge": "FAQ",
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Answers to the most important questions about digital property presentation",
    "q1": "What is a digital display?",
    "a1": "A digital display is a virtual presentation that you create in our cloud portal. You define which properties appear on it and how the display looks. The special part: You can show this digital display on as many physical screens as you want – you only pay once. If you want to show different content, simply create another digital display.",
    "q2": "Do I need special hardware?",
    "a2": "No. You can use any internet-enabled display – whether an existing Smart TV or a professional signage display. You choose the hardware, we provide the software.",
    "q3": "How many properties can I display at once?",
    "a3": "You can present up to 10 properties simultaneously on one display. The layout scales automatically – whether a single top property or multiple listings in tile view. If you want to show more than 10 properties, you need a second digital display and another physical screen.",
    "q4": "How does property management work?",
    "a4": "In the cloud portal, you create properties with key data and photos. You can then assign these to your displays. Changes are visible immediately – no manual updating required.",
    "q5": "How quickly are changes visible?",
    "a5": "Changes appear on the display immediately after saving. The displays automatically update the content, so the current status is always shown.",
    "q6": "Can I manage multiple locations?",
    "a6": "Yes. You can create multiple locations and assign properties specifically. User management is also included – you decide who has access to what.",
    "q7": "How does the QR code per property work?",
    "a7": "When creating a property, you can add a link, for example to the property page on your website. A QR code is automatically generated from this on the display. Interested parties scan and go directly to the information.",
    "q8": "How does the setup work?",
    "a8": "After signing up, you receive access to the cloud portal. There you create your properties and generate a presentation link. This link is opened on the display – done. Alternatively, we offer a complete setup service.",
    "q9": "Do I need the CMS or TV manufacturer's software?",
    "a9": "No. Once the display's web browser is linked to our system, we take over. Think of the display as a pure monitor: All control of your properties and content happens exclusively through our intuitive cloud solution. You don't need to learn or operate any complicated manufacturer software.",
    "q10": "What are the acquisition costs for an office setup?",
    "a10": "It's more affordable than many expect. For a modern 50\" display, you can roughly budget around €500. The big advantage: Thanks to dynamic presentation, you can show up to 10 properties simultaneously or rotating on this single device. An example: Equip your office with three large displays, and hardware costs are around €1,500 (plus monthly software fees). For comparison: The same investment often only gets you conventional, static LED light frames for paper printouts. With us, you get a modern, digital multimedia solution for the same money."
